CSS Units: 

default font size of most web pages is 16px = 12pt = 100% = 1em
vh: Viewport Height
vw: Viewport Width

em: adapt from immediate parent
rem: adapt from root element

Why 100% vw for some elements?
    1, Inline(only occupies the required width) vs 2. Block (by default occupy 100% of the width)
