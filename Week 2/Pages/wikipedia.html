        <span id="a1">T</span>he <strong>cat (<em>Felis catus</em>)</strong>,
        commonly referred to as the <strong>domestic cat</strong> or
        <strong>house cat</strong>, is a small domesticated carnivorous mammal.
        It is the only domesticated species of the family Felidae. Recent
        advances in archaeology and genetics have shown that the domestication
        of the cat occurred in the Near East around 7500 BC. It is commonly kept
        as a house pet and farm cat, but also ranges freely as a feral cat
        avoiding human contact. It is valued by humans for companionship and its
        ability to kill vermin. Its retractable claws are adapted to killing
        small prey like mice and rats. It has a strong, flexible body, quick
        reflexes, sharp teeth, and its night vision and sense of smell are well
        developed. It is a social species, but a solitary hunter and a
        crepuscular predator. Cat communication includes vocalizations like
        meowing, purring, trilling, hissing, growling, and grunting as well as
        cat body language. It can hear sounds too faint or too high in frequency
        for human ears, such as those made by small mammals. It secretes and
        perceives pheromones.
      </p>
      <p>
        Female domestic cats can have kittens from spring to late autumn in
        temperate zones and throughout the year in equatorial regions, with
        litter sizes often ranging from two to five kittens. Domestic cats are
        bred and shown at events as registered pedigreed cats, a hobby known as
        cat fancy. Animal population control of cats may be achieved by spaying
        and neutering, but their proliferation and the abandonment of pets has
        resulted in large numbers of feral cats worldwide, contributing to the
        extinction of bird, mammal and reptile species
      </p>
      <p>
        As of 2017, the domestic cat was the second most popular pet in the
        United States, with 95.6 million cats owned and around 42 million
        households owning at least one cat. In the United Kingdom, 26% of adults
        have a cat, with an estimated population of 10.9 million pet cats as of
        2020. As of 2021, there were an estimated 220 million owned and 480
        million stray cats in the world.

      <h2>Etymology and naming</h2>
      <hr />
      <p>
        The origin of the English word cat, Old English catt, is thought to be
        the Late Latin word cattus, which was first used at the beginning of the
        6th century.
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat#cite_note-4"
          ><sup>[4]</sup></a
        >
        The Late Latin word may be derived from an unidentified African
        language.[5] The Nubian word kaddîska 'wildcat' and Nobiin kadīs are
        possible sources or cognates.[6]
      </p>
      <p>
        The forms might also have derived from an ancient Germanic word that was
        absorbed into Latin and then into Greek, Syriac, and Arabic.[7] The word
        may be derived from Germanic and Northern European languages, and
        ultimately be borrowed from Uralic, cf. Northern Sámi gáđfi, 'female
        stoat', and Hungarian hölgy, 'lady, female stoat'; from Proto-Uralic
        *käďwä, 'female (of a furred animal)'.[8]
      </p>
      <p>
        The English puss, extended as pussy and pussycat, is attested from the
        16th century and may have been introduced from Dutch poes or from Low
        German puuskatte, related to Swedish kattepus, or Norwegian pus,
        pusekatt. Similar forms exist in Lithuanian puižė and Irish puisín or
        puiscín. The etymology of this word is unknown, but it may have arisen
        from a sound used to attract a cat.[9][10]
      </p>
      <p>
        A male cat is called a tom or tomcat[11] (or a gib,[12] if neutered). A
        female is called a queen[13][14] (or sometimes a molly,[15] if spayed).
        A juvenile cat is referred to as a kitten. In Early Modern English, the
        word kitten was interchangeable with the now-obsolete word catling.[16]
        A group of cats can be referred to as a clowder or a glaring.[17]
